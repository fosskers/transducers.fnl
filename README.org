#+title: Transducers: Ergonomic, efficient data processing

#+begin_quote
I think Transducers are a fundamental primitive that decouples critical logic
from list/sequence processing, and if I had to do Clojure all over I would put
them at the bottom.

Transducers are an ergonomic and extremely memory-efficient way to process a
data source. Here "data source" could mean an ordinary Table, but also
potentially large files or generators of infinite data.

Transducers...

- allow the chaining of operations like =map= and =filter= without allocating memory between each step.
- aren't tied to any specific data type; they need only be implemented once.
- vastly simplify "data transformation code".
- are a joy to use!
